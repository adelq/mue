A Fox Searchlight Pictures release by visionary director Darren Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER), BLACK SWAN takes a thrilling and at times terrifying journey through the psyche of a young ballerina whose starring role as the duplicitous swan queen turns out to be a part for which she becomes frighteningly perfect. BLACK SWAN follows the story of Nina (Portman), a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her retired ballerina mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) who zealously supports her daughter,s professional ambition. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. -- (C) Official

Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.. -- (C) Warner Bros.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/78/11167835_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/78/11167835_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/78/11167835_det.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/78/11167835_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Christian Bale","id":"162652645","characters":["Bruce Wayne/Batman"]},{"name":"Anne Hathaway","id":"162656190","characters":["Selina","Selina Kyle"]},{"name":"Tom Hardy","id":"391527059","characters":["Bane"]},{"name":"Marion Cotillard","id":"162688286","characters":["Miranda","Miranda Tate"]},{"name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","id":"162666960","characters":["Blake","John Blake"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1345836"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041731.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_dark_knight_rises/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041731/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041731/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041731/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041731/similar.json"}},{"id":"770681152","title":"Shutter Island","year":2010,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":138,"critics_consensus":"It may not rank with Scorseses best work, but Shutter Islands gleefully unapologetic genre thrills represent the director at his most unrestrained.","release_dates":{"theater":"2010-02-19","dvd":"2010-06-08"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":69,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":76},"synopsis":"Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up for a fourth time for this adaptation of Shutter Island, a novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River).
